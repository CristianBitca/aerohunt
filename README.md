# ✈️ AERO Hunt - Flight Metasearch Engine

**AERO Hunt** is a modern flight metasearch engine that aggregates real-time flight data from various airlines and online travel agencies into one convenient and responsive web interface. Built with a modular, component-based architecture using **React** and **JavaScript**, AERO Hunt aims to simplify the travel planning process by offering a seamless user experience.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** The application is currently **non-functional** because the third-party API used to fetch flight data has become private. The interface is working, but no live data will be displayed until an alternative data source is integrated.
